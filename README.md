**Assignment 2 submission**

In main.cpp, I have implemented the following:
- Naive Voronoi diagrams
- Power diagrams
- L-BFGS optimization

The project can be run by compiling and running main.cpp.

Test.svg is a copy of a voronoi diagram created with 1000 uniformly placed points and uniform weights. Voronoi.svg is a copy of the result of the L-BFGS optimization with a Gaussian target area distribution with the same set of seed points.
